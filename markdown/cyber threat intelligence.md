cyber threat intelligence

the intelligence component is as important as the threat component
specificity is key to intelligence 
data begets information, information begets threat intelligence
find all ways CIA can be compromised 

anything that compormises the CIA of an organization is a cyber threat
anything you need to prevent compromise to the CIA of an organization is the intelligence you need 

compromise of CIA [CONFIDENTIALITY_INTEGRITY_MOBILITY]

- unauthroized access
- destruction
- disclosure
- modification of information
- denial of service

\\\\ not always necessarrily malicious or intentional \\\\

\\\\ CTI \\\\

data that is used to understand a threat actor's motives targets, and attack behaviors.

- used to aid in decision making regarding existing or emerging threats 
- helps align risk with specific threats, helping to reduce the risk of those threats 
- does not mean the threat will not occur, but there will be planned remediation

good threat intelligence is the result of properly analyzed data from quality data sources
that helps a decision making process more fluid 

adversary TTPs

\\\\ tactics

\\\\ techniquies

\\\\ procedures 

- attribution should not be the first course of action
- provide clear unbiased description of what is going on 
- 



\\\\ strategic

provides a broader narrative on emerging trends and risks to outline and define the consequences of a cyber attack. 

\\\\ operational

types \ capabilities \ sophistication of various threat actors and their TTPs

\\\\ tactical

provides specific details on threat actor TTPs
include tools \ processes \ capabilities
not necessarily associated to a specific threat actor 

\\\\ technical 

indicators of attack including: 
ip addresses
hashes
domain names
sender \ subject line of phishing attack
etc.

short shelf life
data changes rapidly 


threat intelligence sources \ quality \ confidence will vary 

\\\\ common sources 

- free community feeds 
adversarys have access as well, short shelf life 
- commercial \ vendor feeds 
see above 
- honeypots 
capture an attacker's TTPs 
- information sharing partnerships 
- open source intelligence [OSINT]
- historical event data
- organizational event data 
- blaclists \ domain \ ip 

\\\\ CTI lifecycle \\\\

\\ requirements 
- knowledge gap assesment
- goal is to understand what TTPs are risks to internal assets

\\ collection
- methods for sourcing and collecting data to support analysis efforts 

\\ processing
- not all data is in the same format
- a normalization of formats to support analysis 

\\ analysis 
- assess confidence \ quality of data collected through collection and processing 
- correlate relationships between TTPs and the data

\\ dissemination
- results of techical analysis must be translated into digestible formats for the appropriate audience
- the different forms of intelligence are audience dependent 

\\ feedback
- receive feedback and responses of impact CTI provided so that adjustments are made to requirements 
- cycle repeats 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

what are stakeholders looking for in  a CTI report

- evidence driven, factual reasoning
- impact to daily operations
- impact to revenue

CTI informs business descisions

- Actionable
- Relevant
- Timely

Pyramid of Pain
- measures potential usefulness of your intel
- higher up on the pyramid, the more useful the information, and the more resources an adversary has to spend
- also measures relative difficulty to obtain that information

if an attacker compromised accounting

- financial data and employee PII is at risk
    this can be exposed, sold, or traded

can tamper with

- invoices
- vendor \ employee archives and records
- financial records
- business functionality



\\\\ research how the threat gets onto the machine in the first place
\\\\ how far into the attack lifecycle would this threat occur




make sure everyone is on the same page regarding what intelligence falls uinder what category 

\\\\\\ techincal intelligence 

- hard data on specific threats 
- mitre ids

\\\\\\ tatical intelligence

- doesnt really tell a story
- provides support for other intelligence 
- think of it like a playstyle


operational

- intelligence regarding a threat actors means 
- 

strategic

- intelligence regarding intent


\\\\ models [data_buckets] \\\\

\\ MITRE ATT&CK \\

- database detailing the general lifecycle for various known threats

            Dr. Karen Achtermann, DC ran a successful family practice in Louisville, Colorado
            for 27 years before moving to Hot Springs. She has a passion for helping the
            community feel better through natural drug-free healthcare, treating patients of
            all ages, including babies and the elderly.  She has 2 sons and 2 dogs and loves
            lake life.  In their spare time, you can find them on the lake paddle boarding,
            kayaking, hiking on nearby trails or walking around Garvin Gardens.

            treatment to anyone you refer.  The highest compliment you can give is the
